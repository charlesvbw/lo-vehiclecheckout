# lo-vehiclecheckout
# This script creates a workbook that can then be imported to Google Sheets to have a 
#timeslotted, day-listing spreadsheet for use in creating the vehicle checkout system for 
#Lowell Observatory.
#First, edit the script to have the proper year.  I could have had it ask you but I wasn't
#prepared to learn all of that just to do something simple.
#Run the script, it will spit out an xlsx file to your C:\tmp\ directory.
